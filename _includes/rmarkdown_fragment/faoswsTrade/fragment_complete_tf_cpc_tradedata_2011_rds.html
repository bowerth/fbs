<ul>
<li>currently, only the data for 2011 is considered</li>
<li>the result has been created using the validate package</li>
<li>values are categorized as outliers according to their unit value <code>uv = value / qty</code></li>
<li>on the y-axis, the ratio of observations categorized as “outliers” is shown</li>
<li>for example if the “outlier coefficient” is set to the value 1.5 (x-axis), this results in 6.4% of the observations to be considered as “outliers” (y-axis)</li>
<li>the variable <code>qty</code> is a combined result of weight (mass) and supplementary quantity measures and represents an item measured in metric tons</li>
<li>for values that are considered as outliers, the weight is calculated as <code>qty = value / uv</code> where <code>uv</code> represents the median unit value for each reporter</li>
<li>observations where the weight is re-calculated receive the <code>flagObservationStatus = I</code> and <code>flagMethod = e</code></li>
